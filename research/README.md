## Time input fields
The purpose of this prototype is both a competitive analysis as well as a recommendation.

Currently our time "select" fields are built as an input with a dropdown list option. However, the input field requires multiple mouse-clicks in order to begin typing input and the dropdown list is incredibly long. Also, there isn't a good way to support time increments other than 15 minutes.

My task was to investigate how competitors and/or industry leaders support date/time input fields and to recommend options based on prototypes.
