## About me

<img class="photo" src="./assets/images/photo.jpg" width="100" />
UI/UX Developer with 9 years of experience creating streamlined and intuitive controls and user experiences through programming and design. Talented at architecting and creating high-fidelity prototypes based off of lo- and hi-fidelity designs. Consistently employs understanding of web accessibility requirements and best practices.

I discovered my love for web development over ten years ago when I learned basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript during personal development time at work. Since then, I have dedicated myself to creating applications that solve technical business problems and provide a positive user experience.
As someone who believes in making the web accessible to everyone, I have taken a personal commitment to ensuring that the work I do is user-friendly in every aspect. I am approachable, transparent, and work with integrity, making me a good citizen in any workplace.

In my current role, I have contributed to multiple internal design systems to fix bugs and enhance components that are used in over 400 product features. I have collaborated with designers and engineers to implement designs and ensure that the products are user-friendly and accessible. I have also created prototypes with HTML, CSS, and React to evaluate design concepts and technical feasibility. Through these experiences, I have developed a deep understanding of design systems and development processes.
