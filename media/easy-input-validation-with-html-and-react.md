# Easy input validation with HTML and React

describe how form validation can get unwieldy

TL;DR of the solution
uses the `input`'s [`pattern`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#pattern) attribute
uses the `:valid` and `:invalid` CSS pseudo-classes to display error messages
uses the `input`'s `checkValidity` to check the validity (test with `reportValidity`) too
uses the `input`'s `setCustomValidity` to display a custom message

Benefits
    accessibility
    native HTML attributes
    code management

Implementation
## Basic Setup
This guide assumes that you already know how to build a simple `<input />` as a stateful component with React's `useState` hook and the `input`'s `value` and `onChange` attributes. For further information you can read React's [input API reference](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/input). Let's take a quick look at our basic setup.

We are going to use minimal CSS styling throughout so that we can focus just on the HTML structure and React functionality. At the end of this guide, I'll include some quick styling that will make it more visually appealing.

### HTML
Not much to see here, and we won't be using it anymore beyond this `#root` element.
```html
<div id="root"></div>
```

### CSS
Simple alignment of the `#root` container to get our examples into the center of the viewport.
```css
#root {
  width: 100vw;
  height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### JS
Creates a simple `label` and `input` for entering a string of text to be used as someone's username.
```javascript
import React, { useState } from "https://esm.sh/react";
import ReactDOM from "https://esm.sh/react-dom";


function RootContainer() {
  const [username, setUsername] = useState('');
 
  function handleUsernameChange(e) {
    setUsername(e.target.value);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <label for="signup-username">Username</label>
      <input id="signup-username" type="text" value={username} onChange={handleUsernameChange} required />
    </div>
  );
}


const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <RootContainer />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```

### Result

    this setup assumes you already know how to connect an input to react state management
    input and attributes
        start with type=text for simplicity
        pattern
        validity
            verify whether validity is always there or only if pattern is used
    react setup for input (leave details out)
    include a ref (link)
    show validity and valid state
    screen reader output
Other input types
    password
    email
    link to other types
